# JavaFXHangman
This is a javafx hangman game designed to be sleek and custom. It has animations and uses the JFoenix library. It features an always-on-top functionality, state persitence, and a wordlist of almost 1000 words. You can, however, make your own wordlist if you would like. If anyone enjoys this game and wants a bigger word list or some reasonable feature, just drop me a line, and I'd be happy to oblige.

If you would like to play this game, there is an installer called FXHangmanInstaller.exe that is very straightforward to use.
